# Hangman
Hangman is a classic word guessing game.
In this version, the computer generates a random word and the player has to guess the letters in the word one by one.
The player starts with 6 lives and loses one life for each incorrect guess.
The game ends when the player either guesses all the letters in the word or runs out of lives.

## How to play
Follow the prompts in the game to guess letters. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the display.
If the letter is not in the word, you will lose one life.
The game ends when either all the letters in the word have been revealed or you run out of lives.

## Modifying the word list
You can modify the list of words that the game uses by editing the hangman_words.py file.
Simply add or remove words from the word_list list to customize the game.

## Dependencies
- hangman_words: a module containing a list of words that the game can use
- hangman_art: a module containing ascii art for various stages of the game

## Requirements
Requires Python 3.x to run.
